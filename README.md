# Install i3-gaps, polybar and my dot files for Kali Linux


This is very basic script for installing i3, i3-gaps and polybar on Kali Linux. Optionally it will copy my dot files to your config folders.

**Tested on Kali Linux 2020.2a & 2020.3**



## Dot Files


If you want to copy my dot files uncomment last 2 lines and change ~ for /home/$USER in path if you are not using kali as root.

These dot files are mainly mine backup but can be a good starting point for you. 

This is how it looks with my dot files:
